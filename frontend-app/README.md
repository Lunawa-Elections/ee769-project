# README for Android Java Project

## Overview
This README outlines the structure and functionalities of key Java classes in the Android application for image processing and server communication. The application focuses on user interaction through a camera interface, managing user sessions, and handling network requests.

## Key Java Classes

### MainActivity.java
- **Purpose:** Acts as the entry point for the application, handling initial setup, user login, and navigation.
- **Features:**
  - **User Authentication:** Manages user login processes.
  - **Server URL Configuration:** Allows the user to set or reset the server URL used for API requests.
  - **Navigation:** Redirects to the `CameraActivity` after successful login.

### CameraActivity.java
- **Purpose:** Manages the camera functionality within the app, allowing users to take pictures and view status updates.
- **Features:**
  - **Camera Access and Permissions:** Handles camera permissions and captures images upon user request.
  - **Image Upload:** Sends captured images to the server.
  - **Session Management:** Includes logout functionality, returning the user to `MainActivity`.
  - **Status Display:** Shows the count of successfully processed images.

### RetrofitClient.java
- **Purpose:** Provides a singleton Retrofit instance for making HTTP requests.
- **Features:**
  - **HTTP Client Configuration:** Configures and maintains a Retrofit client with logging capabilities.
  - **Dynamic Server URL:** Supports updating the base URL at runtime to accommodate different server endpoints.

## Additional Files
- **activity_main.xml, activity_camera.xml, fragment_url.xml**
  - **Purpose:** Define the layouts for the main activity, camera functionality, and URL configuration fragment respectively.
  - **Usage:** These XML files layout the user interface, controlling how elements like buttons, text fields, and camera views are presented to the user.

## Functionality Details
Each class and layout file contributes to the overall functionality of the application, providing a seamless user experience from login to image capture and server communication. The use of Retrofit simplifies network operations, ensuring efficient communication with backend services.

## Conclusion
This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the roles and responsibilities of various components in the Android application. It ensures that developers and new contributors can quickly comprehend and integrate with the existing codebase.
